According to my experiment and calculation, different order should have different threshold. For example, case1: reorder_prob(A) = 0.9, reorder_prob(B) = 0.3 expectation(F1(A)) = 0.81 expectation(F1(A B))=0.71 case2 reorder_prob(A) = 0.3, reorder_prob(B) = 0.2 expectation(F1(A)) = 0.28 expectation(F1(A B))=0.313333333
